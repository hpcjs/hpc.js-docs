# Randomness

## Introduction

Execution of threads is deterministic, meaning that without exposure to external variables, each kernel invocation will run exactly the same way. This wouldn't be useful to us, but luckily we have the `threadId` parameter, which lets us distinguish threads from each other. Randomness has a similar problem: we want it to be different on each thread, but unlike the thread ID, we also need it to be unpredictable.

## Controlling Randomness

Our solution to this was to create a buffer of random seeds generated by `Math.random()` on the CPU, and have kernels pull from this array depending on their thread ID. Naturally, the larger we make this buffer, the more "random" your randomness will seem (imagine a case where we only had one random seed to choose from).

To control how large this buffer is, use the `options.numRandSeeds` property on the `GPUInterface` constructor. By default, it's set to 65536, which should be good enough for most applications. If, however, that's not large enough for your application, you may want reach for `2 ** 24` or even further!
